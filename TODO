* Fix the failure to write multiple INSTRUMENT extensions on output.
* Fix problem with spaces in the instrment names or other parts of map names (breaks the parser).
* Note that extra spaces at end of things saved as header string fields, such as instrument NAME.
* write PixelMap that scales a lookup-table template.
* Change WCSFit to allow configuring more general instrument (or exposure) maps, including the TemplateMap
* Photometric fitting: need to ghost PixelMap -> PhotoMap, collections, CoordAlign->PhotoAlign, PhotoDetection, all to go into a PhotoFit.
