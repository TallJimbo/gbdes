* Hex values read for Expressions.

* New nightwise priors using time structure functions
* Atmospheric parameters for nightly priors?

* Update documentation: PixelMap.tex and the fitting classes.
* Document PhotoFit, MakeColors and all their parameters.
* Gracefully recenter all the exposure's RA's and Dec's.

* Write YAML to TPV fitter program.

* Roll back alpha while clipping instead of recalculating full matrix again

* Able to turn off the clip-entire-match step at the end?

* Why is issueMap so slow?

* Write local-transformation code.

* Reduce chunk size in WCSFit

* Subroutinize various things in WCSFit to clean up main() code.

* Allow individual systematic errors per instrument or exposure?

* Get MJD into exposure

* Fix up MagColors and the Apply* codes.

* Big problem in YAML that WCS and Map cannot share a name.

* Sort fit output by exposure name & show names in table

* Color PixelMap

* Allow compound color maps??

DONE ON WCSFIT:

* Fix PhotoFit etc so that they use the  native projection center of WCS to define
  exposure coordinates.  Or find a way to make this instrument coordinates instead
  of exposure coords.  (done already?)

* Speed up fitting by trying successive Newton steps (with fixed quadratic) instead
  of Marquardt (on newton branch - done earlier than yaml stuff)

* Have a CAL_PATH environment variable for tree rings & other files

* Get rid of USE_YAML from astrometry

* Freeze unconstrained parameters in astrometric solutions

* Astrometric PieceMap cleanup to match photometric

* Write fitDefaulted function

* Fix bug in *Fit where device map is Identity (and hence has this name).

* Put defaults into all PixelMaps

* Make freezing of parameters sticky and more economical.

DONE ON WCS & PHOTOFIT
* PMC recognizes things with 0 parameters as fixed

* Put dependsOn into PMC

* WCSFit able to fix parameters of any component map, not just instrument or device

* Put copyParams into PMC

* Get BAND for each exposure or instrument or whatever

* update treatment of "fixed" in PhotoMap plus other utility routines.

* No reference exposures in PhotoFit! One can add them as their own catalogs
  and give identity or simple color PhotoMap.

* Get rid of canonicalExposure argument, can be done in input YAML instead.

* Eliminate extensions with too few matched detections ??

* Let Identity have different names;

* Check propagation of Fixed, DependsOn for Color maps.

* Allow named Identity in PhotoMap.

* WCSFit to only selected instruments
