* Have a CAL_PATH environment variable for tree rings & other files

* Get rid of USE_YAML from astrometry

* Freeze unconstrained parameters in astrometric solutions

* Hex values read for Expressions.

* New nightwise priors using time structure functions
* Atmospheric parameters for nightly priors?

* Update documentation: PixelMap.tex and the fitting classes.
* Document PhotoFit, MakeColors and all their parameters.
* Fix PhotoFit etc so that they use the  native projection center of WCS to define
  exposure coordinates.  Or find a way to make this instrument coordinates instead of exposure coords.
* Gracefully recenter all the exposure's RA's and Dec's.

* Write YAML to TPV fitter program.

* Speed up fitting by trying successive Newton steps (with fixed quadratic) instead of Marquardt (on newton branch)

* WCSFit to only selected instruments

* Roll back alpha while clipping instead of recalculating full matrix again

* Able to turn off the clip-entire-match step at the end?

* Why is issueMap so slow?

* Write local-transformation code.

* Reduce chunk size in WCSFit

* Subroutinize various things in WCSFit to clean up main() code.

DONE ON WCSFIT:
* Astrometric PieceMap cleanup to match photometric

* Let Identity have different names;

* PMC recognizes things with 0 parameters as fixed

* Put dependsOn into PMC

* WCSFit able to fix parameters of any component map, not just instrument or device

* Write fitDefaulted function

* Put copyParams into PMC

* Fix bug in *Fit where device map is Identity (and hence has this name).

* Put defaults into all PixelMaps
