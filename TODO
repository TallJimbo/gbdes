* Fix configure.py to use exposure-level APCORR more gracefully, maybe make more
  general the option to prefer exposure-level keywords.
  
* Fix allfit.py script

* Go through test programs (AUDIT file)

* Occasional segfault in ReadExtensions, something to do with multithreading??

* Use individual systematic errors per extension in MagColor

* Read data (and reject short-count exposures) before degeneracy checks

* Why is final mapCollection slow?

* Hex values read for Expressions.

* New nightwise priors using time structure functions
* Atmospheric parameters for nightly priors?

* Update documentation: PixelMap.tex and the fitting classes.
* Document PhotoFit, MagColor and all their parameters.

* Roll back alpha while clipping instead of recalculating full matrix again

* Reduce chunk size in WCSFit

* Check for underfit exposure after sigma clipping

* is minMatch being used consistently for #matches total vs in fitted detections?

* Make Match and PhotoMatch from the same code, no PhotoMatch in gbtools

* Investigate color term degeneracy breaking
