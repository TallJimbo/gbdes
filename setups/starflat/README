This directory holds the files that are inputs to a standard DECam starflat astrometric & photometric solution.  The file names and content conform to the use of this directory as the --setup argument of the allfit.py script.  There is one file here - basename.config - which would normally be in the working directory for the starflat solution, edited to point to the appropriate input files and renamed to whatever your solutions are going to be called.
